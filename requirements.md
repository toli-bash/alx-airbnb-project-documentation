Backend Feature Requirements
This document outlines the technical and functional requirements for three key backend features of the ALX Airbnb application: User Authentication, Property Management, and Booking System.

1. User Authentication
1.1 Description
This feature manages user registration, login, and session management. It ensures that only authenticated users can access protected parts of the application.

1.2 Functional Requirements
Registration:

Users can create a new account by providing their first name, last name, email, password, and optional phone number.

The system must validate the email format and ensure it is unique.

The system must hash the password before storing it in the database.

Upon successful registration, the user is considered logged in.

Login:

Users can log in using their email and password.

The system must retrieve the user's hashed password from the database and compare it with the provided password.

Upon successful login, the system creates a session for the user.

Logout:

Users can log out, which invalidates their session.

Session Management:

The system must maintain user sessions to track logged-in users.

Sessions should have a configurable expiration time.

The system should use a secure method for storing session data (e.g., in a database or a dedicated session store like Redis).

Password Reset (Optional):

Users can request a password reset.

The system sends a password reset link to the user's email.

The system verifies the reset token before allowing the user to set a new password.

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):

The system supports different user roles: guest, host, and admin.

Different roles have different permissions (e.g., only hosts can create properties, only admins can manage all users).

1.3 Technical Requirements
API Endpoints:

POST /api/users/register: Register a new user.

POST /api/users/login: Log in a user.

POST /api/users/logout: Log out a user.

POST /api/users/reset-password-request: Request a password reset.

POST /api/users/reset-password: Set a new password after verification.

Input/Output Specifications:

Registration:

Input: firstName (string, required), lastName (string, required), email (string, required), password (string, required), phoneNumber (string, optional).

Output: User object (without password hash) and session token on success, error message on failure.

Login:

Input: email (string, required), password (string, required).

Output: User object (without password hash) and session token on success, error message on failure.

Logout:

Input: Session token (in headers or cookies).

Output: Success/failure message.

Validation Rules:

Email must be a valid email address.

Email must be unique in the database.

Password must meet complexity requirements (e.g., minimum length, character types).

All required fields must be present.

Performance Criteria:

Registration and login requests should complete in under 500ms.

Password hashing should be performed using a strong and adaptive algorithm (e.g., bcrypt, Argon2).

The system should be able to handle concurrent login attempts.

Security Considerations:

Password hashing using bcrypt or Argon2.

Protection against brute-force attacks (e.g., rate limiting).

Secure storage of session data.

Protection against common web vulnerabilities (e.g., CSRF, XSS).

2. Property Management
2.1 Description
This feature allows hosts to create, manage, and view property listings.

2.2 Functional Requirements
Create Property:

Hosts can create a new property listing by providing details such as name, description, location, price per night.

The system should validate the input data.

View Property:

Users (guests and hosts) can view property details.

Hosts can view all their properties.

Edit Property:

Hosts can edit their property details.

The system should validate the updates.

Delete Property:

Hosts can delete their properties.

The system should handle any associated bookings or reviews.

List Properties:

Users can list/search properties based on location

Users can filter properties based on price.

2.3 Technical Requirements
API Endpoints:

POST /api/properties: Create a new property.

GET /api/properties/{propertyId}: Get a single property.

GET /api/properties/user/{userId}: Get all properties for a host.

PUT /api/properties/{propertyId}: Update a property.

DELETE /api/properties/{propertyId}: Delete a property.

GET /api/properties?location={location}: Get properties by location

GET /api/properties?minPrice={minPrice}&maxPrice={maxPrice}: Get properties within a price range

Input/Output Specifications:

Create Property:

Input: hostId (UUID, required), name (string, required), description (string, required), location (string, required), pricePerNight (number, required).

Output: Created property object on success, error message on failure.

Get Property:

Input: propertyId (UUID, required).

Output: Property object on success, error message on failure.

Update Property:

Input: propertyId (UUID, required), and fields to update (name, description, location, pricePerNight).

Output: Updated property object on success, error message on failure.

Get Properties By Location

Input: location (string, required)

Output: Array of property objects

Get Properties By Price Range

Input: minPrice (number, optional), maxPrice (number, optional)

Output: Array of property objects

Validation Rules:

All required fields must be present.

pricePerNight must be a positive number.

The user making the request to update/delete a property must be the host of that property.

Performance Criteria:

Property creation and retrieval should complete in under 500ms.

The system should efficiently handle a large number of properties.

Security Considerations:

Authentication is required for creating, updating, and deleting properties.

Authorization is required to ensure that only hosts can manage their own properties.

3. Booking System
3.1 Description
This feature allows users to book properties, manage their bookings, and handle booking status.

3.2 Functional Requirements
Create Booking:

Users can create a new booking by specifying the property_id, start_date, and end_date.

The system must check property availability for the selected dates.

The system must calculate the total_price based on the pricePerNight and the duration of the booking.

The booking status is initially set to "pending."

View Booking:

Users can view their booking details.

Hosts can view bookings for their properties.

Cancel Booking:

Users can cancel their bookings, subject to any cancellation policies.

The system should update the booking status to "canceled."

Confirm Booking:

Hosts can confirm a booking.

The system should update the booking status to "confirmed."

POST /api/bookings: Create a new booking.

GET /api/bookings/{bookingId}: Get a single booking.

GET /api/bookings/user/{userId}: Get all bookings for a user.

Input: propertyId (UUID, required), startDate (date, required), endDate (date, required), userId (UUID, required).

Output: Created booking object on success, error message on failure.

startDate must be before endDate.

The requested dates must be available (i.e., not overlapping with existing bookings for the property).

Performance Criteria:

Booking creation and retrieval should complete in under 500ms.

The system should efficiently handle a large number of concurrent bookings.

Security Considerations:

Authentication is required for creating and managing bookings.

Authorization is required to ensure that users can only manage their own bookings, and hosts can only confirm bookings for their properties.
